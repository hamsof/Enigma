# Enigma
Sprint Estimation project by team members from REWAA Technologies
Using the Fibonacci sequence to estimate the time required to complete a task, users will be able to create a project, add tasks to the project, and estimate the time required to complete the task. The project will be able to track the time spent on each task and the time remaining to complete the task. We will also provide real time chat application to communicate with team members.
